  caption: How does a child develop the knowledge of physical objects and their behavior
    needed to create a simple stack of blocks? Innovative methods to probe infants'
    knowledge of the world, advanced by Liz Spelke, Laura Schulz, and others, have
    led to insights about the nature of this evolving knowledge that enable Josh Tenenbaum
    and others to build models of how children learn how to reason about the physical
    world.
